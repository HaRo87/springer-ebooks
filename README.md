# Setup environment

You need to have a running Python3 installation. 

Assuming you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) you can setup your 
environment with this command:

`conda create -n springer python=3.7 jupyter pandas requests xlrd`

You need to activate the environment via:

`conda activate springer`

Next you need to clone this repo and navigate to it.

Run `jupyter notebook` to spawn your local [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) server.
